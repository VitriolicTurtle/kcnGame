# How to run:
 
It is important to note that the server must be manually restarded when the game mode finishes i.e. when a player wins the game mode.  
Executeable files for game and server provided in google drive.  
Game: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8zfD6XNvAMluZA1Z6ADgM3W0rV2tlsy/view?usp=sharing  
Server: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uTCwMoHf7vcm8HzHuOw5mwY-15sYNFFu/view?usp=sharing  

We highly recommend making a shortcut for the server executable and add -log to the end of the path in the properties section of the shortcut, this makes it easier to close the server and see debug messages.
